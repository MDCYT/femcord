# Instance invites

An instance invite is a code that lets someone create an account, while a server invite adds an existing account to a server. The server records who invited whom, so staff can follow an invite tree and disable a whole branch of spam accounts at once.

## Invite-only registration

Make the instance invite-only, under Registration in Site settings, sets `register.requireInvite`. While it is on, registration refuses a signup without a working instance invite code. Server invites don't count, and a registration token skips the check. An invite stops working once its creator's account is disabled or deleted. With invite-only off, a valid code still records who brought the person in. Signup needs the captcha either way, see [signup.md](signup.md).

A link has the form `https://<instance>/register?instance_invite=<code>`. The `fosscordInvites` plugin adds an Invite code field to the signup form when the instance is invite-only or the link carries a code, and the field shows who sent the invite or that the code doesn't work.

## Invites for members

Members make their own links in User Settings, under Invites below Data & Privacy, with a number of uses and an expiry. The page lists their links and the people who joined through them.

A member's total is the instance default plus any extra invites staff gave them. Each person who joined with one of their invites uses one, and the unused uses of their working links are held back, so a member with 3 invites can make one link for 3 people or 3 links for one each. Revoking an unused link gives its uses back. Staff invites never count against anyone, and bots can't make instance invites.

| -------------------------------------------- | ------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `register.instanceInvites.perUser`           |       3 | Invites each member gets.                                                             |
| `register.instanceInvites.minAccountAgeDays` |       7 | Days an account has to exist before it gets the default. Extra invites apply at once. |
| `register.instanceInvites.maxUsesPerInvite`  |       3 | Most people one member link can let in.                                               |
| `register.instanceInvites.maxAgeDays`        |      30 | Longest a member link can last. 0 allows links that never expire.                     |

Site settings shows these under Registration. Member links last at least 1 hour, and `limits.rate.routes.instanceInvite` allows 10 writes and 60 reads per user per minute by default.

## Admin dashboard

Instance invites, under People & servers, lists every invite with its creator, uses, expiry and state. Create invite makes a staff invite with up to 10,000 uses or 0 for no limit, an expiry of up to 365 days or none, and a note only staff see. Opening an invite shows everyone who joined with it, and revoking it can also disable those accounts or everyone below the invite in the tree.

The user drawer has an Invites card with the account's chain of inviters, its remaining invites, an Extra invites field from -1000 to 10000, the tree of accounts it brought in and a Disable everyone they brought in button. Disabling a branch disables each account, revokes their working invites and signs them out, up to 32 levels deep and 10,000 accounts. It skips accounts with `OPERATOR`, `MANAGE_USERS` or `MANAGE_GUILDS`.

Reading invites needs `VIEW_USERS`. Creating, revoking and setting extra invites need `MANAGE_USERS`, and disabling a branch from the user drawer needs `MODERATE_USERS`.
