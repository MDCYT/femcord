# Admin dashboard

The dashboard is at `/admin`. Operators see every page, and [setup.md](../self-hosting/setup.md#operator-account) explains how to grant the operator right. Other staff see only the pages, fields and buttons their rights allow. [admin-api-coverage.md](../development/admin-api-coverage.md) maps which API operations the dashboard covers.

## Pages

| Group            | Page                   | Needs             | What it controls                                                                                    |

Lists show 50 rows a page. The Users and Servers pages read each next page with the cursor the previous page returned, so page 2,000 costs the same as page 2, and the admin API takes that cursor as `after`. Every other admin list refuses an `offset` past 10,000.

Command+K or Ctrl+K focuses the sidebar search, which finds pages, people, servers and IP addresses. Destructive actions ask first in a dialog that names the target and the count.

## Staff roles

A staff role is a named set of instance rights with a position, a color and a badge switch. An account's rights are its own `rights` plus the rights of every role it holds, and a role can never carry `OPERATOR`. The first start seeds these roles, which operators can rename, edit, reorder or delete on the Staff roles page:

| Role            | Position | Rights                                                                                                    | Badge |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Admin           | 4        | `MANAGE_USERS`, `MANAGE_GUILDS`, `MANAGE_MESSAGES`, `MANAGE_STAFF`, `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG` and everything below | yes   |
| Moderator       | 3        | `MODERATE_USERS`, `VIEW_MODERATION`, `VIEW_USERS`, `MANAGE_MESSAGES`                                      | yes   |
| Support         | 2        | `SUPPORT_USERS`, `VIEW_USERS`, `VIEW_MODERATION`, `RESEND_VERIFICATION_EMAIL`                             | yes   |
| Read-only audit | 1        | `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG`, `VIEW_MODERATION`                                                                       | no    |

| Right             | Allows                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MANAGE_USERS`    | Everything the next four rights allow, plus profile edits, account deletion, automod settings and instance invites. |
| `VIEW_USERS`      | Search and open accounts, and list addresses, badges, the shop catalog and instance invites.                  |
| `MODERATE_USERS`  | Violations, suspensions, disabling, IP bans, report decisions, automod actions, join requests and raids. Includes `VIEW_MODERATION`. |
| `VIEW_MODERATION` | Read reports, violations, IP bans and the Automod page.                                                       |
| `SUPPORT_USERS`   | Password reset links, turning off two-factor authentication, signing out sessions, marking an email verified. |
| `MANAGE_STAFF`    | Create, edit, reorder, delete and assign staff roles.                                                         |
| `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG`  | Read the audit log.                                                                                           |

Staff can't act on an account at or above their own level, which is their highest role position, and can't assign or move a role to it or above or give a role a right they don't have. They also can't open that account's page, sessions, two factor methods, invites, standing, staff roles, settings, widgets or pride badges, though the user search still lists it. Operators are above every role. A role with the badge switch on shows a staff badge on its members' profiles.

## Audit log

The server logs every successful staff action, with the actor, the target, the action and the request body with secrets removed. The Audit log page filters by staff member, target, area, action and time, and the user drawer lists the staff actions taken on that account.

## Overview

The Overview page shows counts of accounts, servers, messages, people online and open reports, with their change against the previous period, and activity charts over 24 hours, 7, 30 or 90 days. The reports and automod charts need `VIEW_MODERATION`, and the federation and upload charts need `OPERATOR`.

## Users

The Users page has tabs for local accounts, accounts from other instances, IP addresses and IP bans, and can filter to suspended accounts, accounts waiting for approval and accounts with a join reason. The user drawer edits the account, its profile and cosmetics, rights, standing, violations, sessions, two-factor authentication, staff roles and invites, and each field needs the right listed above for it. The dashboard never shows password hashes, tokens, two-factor secrets, encryption keys or recovery codes.

### Removing spam accounts

Select rows, or select the whole page and then every account that matches the search, up to the newest 5,000. The bar above the list then disables or deletes them. Disabling signs the accounts out and can also delete their messages, which needs `MANAGE_MESSAGES`. Deleting needs `MANAGE_USERS`, removes their messages, DMs and memberships, and hands each owned server to the member with the highest role. Your own account and accounts at or above your level are skipped.

### Users and servers from other instances

This instance stores the people its users meet on other instances as shadow users named `name@instance`, and the servers they join there as mirror servers. The Users and Servers pages list them in Other instances tabs with read-only drawers. Staff can disable, suspend, sign out, resolve violations of or delete a shadow user, and delete a mirror server. A deleted shadow user comes back the next time they talk to someone here, so block them on the Federation page instead.

## IP addresses and bans

The user drawer lists the address an account registered from and the last address of each session, with how many accounts share each one. The IP addresses tab lists addresses with the most accounts first, and opening one can remove all its accounts and ban the address. The IP bans tab lists and lifts bans.

- Registration from a banned address gets HTTP 403. Sign-in checks the address after the password, so staff can still sign in from it.
- A banned account that signs in from a new address or browser bans that address or browser one step further, and a spread browser ban expires after 7 days. Lifting a ban lifts the bans it spread.
- Address and browser bans never catch staff.
- Private, loopback and Cloudflare addresses, and your own address, can't be banned. Users from other instances arrive on loopback, so address bans never catch them.

## Reports

The Reports page lists reports newest first, filtered by status or reported user. A second report about the same thing updates the open one, and message reports save the 15 messages before and the 10 after the reported one. The report drawer shows other open reports about the same message or user and can close them all. [e2ee.md](e2ee.md#reporting-encrypted-messages) covers reports from encrypted conversations, and [automod.md](automod.md#federation) covers "Automod on another instance" reports.

## Servers

The server drawer edits a server's settings, levels, premium tier and feature flags, and its channels and roles within the instance limits.

The Members section lists members 50 at a time by user ID, with Load more members reading the next page through a cursor instead of an offset, so a server with millions of members costs the same per page. Search matches an exact user ID or part of a username, display name or nickname. Opening a member sets their nickname and roles, times them out for 60 seconds to 28 days or ends a timeout, removes them from the server, or bans them and optionally deletes their messages from the last hour, day or 7 days. The Bans section lists bans the same way with the reason and who banned them, and lifts a ban. The Invites section creates an invite to a text, voice, announcement, stage or forum channel that expires after 30 minutes to 7 days or never and allows 1 to 100 uses or any number, lists every invite newest first with its uses, expiry and creator, and revokes invites. The vanity link stays in the server's own settings. The Emoji, stickers and sounds section lists up to 1,000 of each, renames an emoji with 2 to 32 letters, numbers or underscores, edits a sticker's name, description and tags, edits a soundboard sound's name, volume and emoji and plays it, and deletes any of them with its file. Emoji that an integration manages are read only. Uploading stays in the client. Each change writes a staff audit entry and an entry in the server's own audit log with the reason you give. Staff can't change members who are staff at or above their own level, can't time out or remove the server owner, and can't time out members whose roles grant Administrator, because Administrator ignores timeouts. Every route needs `MANAGE_GUILDS`.

## Shop and sticker packs

The Shop page manages custom packs and items, and renames, reorders or restyles mirrored packs, with Reset to restore the originals. Deleting a custom item removes it from every profile.

The Sticker packs page holds packs imported from Discord, as [setup.md](../self-hosting/setup.md#standard-stickers) describes, and packs made on the instance. Stickers are PNG, APNG, GIF, WebP or Lottie JSON files of up to 4 MiB with names of 2 to 30 characters. A pack holds up to 200 stickers and an instance up to 500 packs, and open clients pick up changes within an hour. Deleting a pack also removes its stickers from old messages, so hide a pack to retire it. While `externalRequests.discordStickerPacks` is on, an instance with no packs imports Discord's catalog again.

## System

The Link previews card on the System page shows whether the `PUBLIC_FETCH_PROXY` proxy answers and whether `externalRequests.thirdParty` is on, see [external-services.md](../self-hosting/external-services.md#hiding-the-servers-address).

## Site settings

Site settings holds the instance configuration, and everything it doesn't show is in the configuration file described in [setup.md](../self-hosting/setup.md#configuration-file). [signup.md](signup.md), [invites.md](invites.md), [automod.md](automod.md), [homepage.md](homepage.md) and [external-services.md](../self-hosting/external-services.md) describe their own settings.

The Client addresses card sets how the server finds a visitor's address for rate limits, bans and the address caps. Address header sets `security.forwardedFor`. Automatic, the blank value, and `X-Forwarded-For` both read `X-Forwarded-For` from trusted proxies and `CF-Connecting-IP` from Cloudflare. The other choices are `CF-Connecting-IP`, `True-Client-IP`, `X-Real-IP` and `Fly-Client-IP`. Trusted proxies sets `security.trustedProxies`, a comma separated list of addresses, CIDR ranges or the names `loopback`, `linklocal` and `uniquelocal`, which is all three names when blank and takes effect after a restart. Under Docker, `scripts/docker-configure.js` resets the header to `X-Forwarded-For` and the proxies to `TRUSTED_PROXIES` on every start, so set the proxies in `.env` there.

Slowmode applies to everyone, server owners and moderators included, unless `limits.channel.allowSlowmodeBypass` is on.
