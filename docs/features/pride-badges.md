# Pride badges

People pick pride flags in Settings, Profiles, or at signup, and the flags show as badges on their profile. **Pride flags are permanent.** No config key, environment variable, admin setting or plugin setting can hide or disable the badges, the picker or flag picking at signup, and the `FosscordPride` plugin can't be turned off. The catalog never has heterosexual or cisgender flags. `scripts/tests/pride-permanent.test.cjs` enforces this. Each person can still reorder their own badges or hide one of them from their own profile in the Customize Your Badges panel, as Discord allows for its own badges. That setting belongs to the person and changes nothing for anyone else's profile.

## The catalog

The picker offers 85 flags, all served as local SVGs, so picking or showing a badge makes no external request. 39 come unmodified from [b3yc0d3/twemoji-flags](https://github.com/b3yc0d3/twemoji-flags) at commit `1eee036f2567edc1f56f7dcb4105eae5a347cc7b`, without its heterosexual flag and its template. The other 46 are drawn locally on the upstream template's silhouette.

`assets/badge-icons/twemoji-flags/manifest.json` records every file with its slug and SHA-256 checksum. The graphics are CC BY 4.0, and the picker and [ATTRIBUTION.md](../../assets/badge-icons/twemoji-flags/ATTRIBUTION.md) credit them.

Badge IDs run from `8000000000000000001` to `8000000000000000086`. `8000000000000000043` belonged to the removed heterosexual flag and is never reused. A new flag takes the next ID and goes at the end of `src/api/util/utility/prideBadges.ts`, and a shipped slug or ID never changes. A stored selection the catalog doesn't know is returned unchanged to its owner, and saving an unknown slug fails validation.

## Supplemental flags

Ten supplemental flags keep selections that predate the upstream snapshot: rainbow, the original eight-stripe rainbow, Philadelphia, intersex-inclusive Progress, seven-stripe lesbian, five-stripe gay men, gray-asexual, grayromantic, unlabeled and androgyne. Their colors follow [Gilbert Baker](https://gilbertbaker.com/rainbow-flag-origin-story/), [Valentino Vecchietti](https://www.intersexequality.com/intersex-inclusive-progress-pride-flag/), [AUREA](https://www.aromanticism.org/en/resources-1), [AVEN](https://wiki.asexuality.org/w/index.php?title=Asexual_flag) and [Microsoft's pride flag references](https://github.com/microsoft/Pride).

The other 36 follow the lead flag on each term's [LGBTQIA+ Wiki](https://lgbtqia.wiki) page, with colors sampled from it and shapes redrawn by hand, so no wiki artwork is copied or traced. Romantic flags built on a sexuality flag reuse that flag's colors at half strength with a full-color heart in the middle. The manifest's `supplementalSlugs` lists them all.

Where a term has competing flags:

- Bigender uses fireprincette's flag, which the wiki calls the most common, instead of the older seven-stripe flag whose creator is disputed.
- Hijra uses the Tumblr user Samir's 2018 flag. The wiki notes that hijra communities organize under the transgender and rainbow flags and that the flag's creator is not hijra.
- Gender questioning uses enbygsrd's flag for questioning gender instead of the general questioning flag.
- Two-spirit uses the feathers on the rainbow, the design the wiki lists with the most institutional use.

## Picking flags at signup

The register form has an optional Pride flags section under the password field. It reads the catalog from `GET /api/v9/auth/pride-badges`, which needs no login and allows 30 requests a minute per IP, so new flags show up without a client change. The chosen slugs are saved on the new account, so the flags are on the profile from the first load. An unknown slug fails registration with a `pride_badges` field error.

## Regenerating and checking

`bun scripts/pride-badge-art.cjs` redraws the local badge images from the pinned originals and the template and updates the supplemental checksums in the manifest. `--check` verifies them without writing. The tests:

```sh
bun test scripts/tests/pride-permanent.test.cjs scripts/tests/pride-badges.test.cjs scripts/tests/pride-badge-art.test.cjs scripts/tests/pride-profile-refresh.test.cjs scripts/tests/signup-pride-badges.test.cjs
```

The browser check `ORIGIN=http://localhost:<port> bun scripts/dev/pride-badges-smoke.mjs` loads every image on a seeded dev server and checks saving, clearing, search, friend updates and admin-assigned badges.
